P1 explanation

int getbest(void* ptr, int param size_t n_function){
	int(**functions)(int) = ptr;
	int best_result = -0x7FFFFFFF;
	int function = 0;
	for(size_t i=0; i < n_functions; i++){
		int res = functions[i](param); // this part was the important part
		if(res > best_result){
			best_result = res;
			best_function = i;
		}	
}
}

b.find_best = getbest;

The pointer is beginning of array and array has pointer to some function.

P2: 
file-system stuff. 
tester -> fs -> drive
file system must support 4 operations. 
if its works, it must return 0. Non 0 is indicated error. 
must save all the data to hard drive, no global or static variable

has a cylinder and sectors in each cylinder and each bytes in sector

2thing we could do
either read a sector or write a sector
better go read wiki at file-location system

filesystem:
msdos returning -EINVAL makes everything quite good
http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/ext2/namei.c?v=3.16
https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx/blob/master/fs/fat/namei_msdos.c

layer file system:
writes on top of existing filesystem

boot sequence:
	boot strapping = keep loading from kernel and kernle will load itself.
	BIOS = chip in the motherboard, and hardcoded to and contains to find the devices and start OS
	UEFI = has extra features, 
	http://www.dosv.jp/feature/1103/17.htm

boot loader:
	if you don't want it = then you want to manage booting. 
	Lilo = linux or windows loader, basic of basic
		lilo keeps enough info from boot sector and keep the kernel running
		https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/jp/linux/library/l-bootload/
		it does not support other OS
		if the boot loader does have option to get to other bootloader its possible to have 2 OS
	Grub, 
		go to grub.cfg
		you don't have to update boot-sector, can look through the filesystem and find the kernel
	go check linux-soruce-0.11/boot a
	in 3.16 go /arch/x86/boot 

interrupt service routines:
	something that interrupt these signals(like keyboard) = BIOS
