it will not power supply stuff, not like usb
data pins(d1 - d7):
set up the bytes and agree with device attached to
strobe = clock signal = tells when to give bytes
err#= error codes, and sometimes may return "on fire"
those data pins are free to turn on and off, 
actually it has very very few mili amps.

Powerswitch Tail 2:

Serial data transmission(serial ports);
higher frequency, and only one pin to transmit.
obviously, now usb is taken out the concept and adapt it very nicely

usb pin:
2 power related, and 2 related for data

last semesters' final exams:
Tuesday class time
both on tuesday

binary arithmatic, macros, 
/proc
bootloaders (in depth) -
memory managment

parent, child, and zombie processes (forkbomb related)
interrupts (keylogger thingy)
medium name of terms, what is zombie process?
