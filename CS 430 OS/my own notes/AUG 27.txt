How long do programmers program:
	probably 2 hours? and rest of the day play ping-pong
	focus is real

project1 info:
	wget isoptera.lcsc.edu/~seth/cs430/p1.zip
	make
	gcc tester.o solution.o -o project1
	./project1
	vim ***
	
Finding stuff in the kernel:
	***really need to be aware of the versions = uname -a
	cd /usr/share
	*** control c is the stop

	find | linux 
	cd /usr/src Å® ls = all the source code of linux
	cd linux-source-3.2 Å® ls Å® find | grep ".c$" | wc ***wc = wordcount***
	grep -r -i broken * | grep -i cow *** i is igonre case, r is only, * everything***
	"^" starts with what ever, "$"ends with whatever, 
	| = for helping next search , named pipeline

	find | grep -i camel Ç»Ç«Ç»Ç«
	grep -r -i broken * | wc "number of lines, words, letters"
	grep -r -i wrong | grep -i broken = only broken will be highlighted

Review of C Programming on Unix
Tools :
	man = manual = system open command
	you can search stuff with just typeing /*** 
	
	gcc compiler used in kernel, sometime other computers may use intel c compiler
	kernel c programming depends on the compiler ex i =i++ Å® the other difference
	have to use the same version as kernel using = very important
	
	kernel debugging gdb

	vim/emacs/nano/pico/whatever = text editors
	
	make = making a program
	gcc -std=c99 solution.c tester.c -o project1 = compiling the 
	make = gcc tester.o solution.o -o project 1 , .o is object file = already compiled file
	make is much faster and benefitable if the gcc is very long
	vim Makefile = can see what make can do

	cvs/subversion/git = editors
	git clone isoptera:/home/git/ExpandArea = see everything in that area
	git log = check the log
	its a tool to makesure everything is in uptodate
	
C versions:
	skipped

speed comparison: c vs. python
	sometimes assembly is faster, but most of the time C is faster
	c is very fast, java is a lot faster than Python, c++ is comparable to C
	need to respect how much memory would be used esp. union
	union is like a struct and char, but will never gonna use both = only either
	especially memory is very respected in mobiles
	
Pointers:
	pointers can poin to any type, since it's just a number
	size_t = give us right type for the right architecture
	64 bit address sceam = can hold data stracture of 2-32 bits
	*** must check read**
	ssize_t = system call that shows error, on error -1 is returned
	sizeof = tells the size of variable, 
	pointer arithmatic *** going to next time***


skipped to goto:
	https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotoï∂
	error handling routine, 
	have a random functionÅ@Å®Å@
	Å™ and then it will automatically go down to the particular named place ex. goto err_exit_all
	hacked version of exception handling
	goto statment could be harmful = leads to spaghetti code = impossible to go through
	***read wiki***
	but definately used a lot in kernel for the error conditions
	you can use goto for everything, but not recommended
	
	setjmp and longjmp

lab assignment
	maybe scavenger hunt in linux-code
