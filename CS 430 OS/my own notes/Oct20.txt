Lab5, 6, 7 is in row
There are decent amount of instructions
Linux 3.2 is mostly comparable with linux 3.3(kinda~

Lab6 
blinking
Lab7 
control blinking


Stress testing:
/proc directory entries
service integrated in kernel will allow some services
= when application want access web-cam = instead of application goofing off, kernel does it
Potetntial attack on this

sudo su:
allow us to play around with the modules(may cause non-booting too though)



/proc/crypto_services.ko
crpto_services.c (probably in the example
writing something into the file and return incripted version
(things we were doing lasttime)
return 0 was the problem, = return 0 is acepted 0 bytes, which will give nothing to user
return 1 = mean successing on one character = could cause to run function the amount of character of times


User level and kernel level difference:
there might be slight spelling mistake

kernel modules and working on kernel actual directory:
working on modules may cause problem, but
if you try to re-write the actual directory may cause no more boot

Linux boot CD =
the Linux kernel will boot from the CD
(usually used to install OS)

preemptable area

タスクを一時的に中断する動作である

killcat -9 cat:
usually kills the running program as soon as possible(with -9)
however usually kernel will not get stopped because they are prioritizing their job
on much higher level
