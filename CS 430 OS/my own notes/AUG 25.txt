Aug 25 Kernel

write software in Kernel
Kernel programming is really hard.

Android uses really similar OS as Linux
source code is available for Linux, but not at all for the others
Nobody uses NetBSD and W2K
we cant do kernel in isoptera + no access to admin

Role of the OS kernel:
now its really hard to program to crash the OS
program is not allowed to access to divices on CPU

Storage(filesystems):
cmd - read 
systemcall = very direct in Linux
cmd - open  = its actually letting the section of disk(named sector)
Now SD card is not like a table(stack of stuffs) but it makes like tree.

Memory(virtual memory)
	has addresses per byte = per memory.

	32 bits limitation and uselessness of attachments because of lack of memory.
	64 bits and ask them to have 128 gb, if memory runs out then OS will start to use hard-drive
	watch one movie, stops it + minimize + forget then start watching 2nd movie
		- the main memory will be used for 2nd movie and 1st movie will go to hard-drive
		- if u watch 1st movie, it will take forever

I/O and device drivers:
	OS will constantly asks gadget "do you have anything to say now?" (gadget USB変換機など）
	Mouse, interrupts cpu all the time, can have very very slight amount of lag
	Somehow all of them must merged together 
Keylogger = キー入力を監視するソフトウェア/ハードウェア

Processes and scheduling:
OS needs to find right processers to manage the tasks
bogoMips = approximate power of the processor

Disc Operating System:
https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_(OS)
DOS did not have protective mode = easily store and read memory.
Program crash →　take out the program disk → turn off the computer → put in DOS

Networking:
OS one program can not retrieve data from other program, but all of those things is not in OS

Security:

Loader:
manage file system for the user

/proc (what is it?):
usually file system deals with hard-drive
file system does not show real files(?) = giving u somekind of info about system

how to make a file in /proc for a function that can return some number

/dev:
shows what gadgets on the computer
sda = hard-drive 

kernel module = doesnt have main but a lot of functions
kernel c coding = u dont use at all in application
