Function pointer
	read function and write function
	(void*)(irq_handler) for supporting a lot of type (void*) op
	Stacks:
	-cast = inform the computer to change the type of stuff into smth else
	-it will cause segmentation fault at 2nd row due to function pointer issue
	-the stack starts from top of memory, and stack frame for return-pointer
	-call the functiong Å®Å@creating another function count Å® returning pointer of count
	-main can call the function Å® but it will overwritten by printfÅ@
	- Å® so the pointer does not work because it does not have memory
#include<stdio.h>

void* return_pointer(int n){
	int c = n;
	int count(){
		return c++;
	}
	return (void*)count;
}

int main(){
	void* count_function = return_pointer(5);
	int (*cfp)() = count_function;
	printf("%d\n", cfp());//this part is the problem
	printf("%d\n", cfp());
	printf("%d\n", cfp());
	printf("%d\n", cfp());
	return 0;	
}
	- it will work just fine if we don't overwrite it
	- the fixed one has new function named count.

firstclass function:
	for python, we can create as much function in the function, check return_function.py
	you can do in c++11 but not in c!
	check out take_self.c:
	- functoin that takes itself as a parameter 
	- its type of recursion = but its stupid and not efficient
	- but function pointer is quite versatile, 
	- you must use (void*) at line 4
	
Making in struct - like a class:
	check out struct_of_functions.c
	struct cat *self = python can actually do it by itself(in this case we did manually)
	it is rare to see data members mixed into struct files

	object oriented programming
	
bitwise comparison:
	& | ^ << >> (and or xor leftShift, rightShift)
	control shifter = like switches
	1100 & 1011 = 1000 basically and it very helpful to target one place and turnoff
	1010 | 0100 = 1110 or used for turnon

	shifts = not usually used 
	<< = insertion, >>=extraction
	
	
Device Drivers and control registers:
	bitwise switches used for controling devices

	flags(or control) is assigned to check if its on or not
