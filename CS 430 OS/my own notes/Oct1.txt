To prepare for mid-term:
	understand both p1 and p2
	p2 questions = atleast know the pseudocode
	better read chapters 1 and 2(while watchig through the notes)
	closed book and notes
	on next class

Device Drivers.
	das.c
	handles devices' interrupts
	dasmatch = actually finds if the device is match or not
	disattach = hold parameters related with device and hand back somehting u need to with device
		    das_softc* 
		    buffer = date the we read the device
	read = produce data (sampling data), 
	interrupt handler = its dealing with the device (if you kill it, then PC will be locked).
			    usually sleep for a while and handle(wake-up) again
			    it occurs every time when sample comes in
	you can check this das.c for a lot of help for P2
	

Linux 0.11:
	rs_init
	http://guiquanz.me/p/linux-0.11/kernel/chr_drv/serial.c.html
	time is used a lot in kernel(kernel does not trust the clock on the PC).
	
schedulers:	
	which processor run next + how long you can run?
	ex. node in cluster = must be long schedule
