lab1 info:
	vim export.c ¨ then just type in 311
	No.1 need to find the function pointer in a struct member (like c++ right after the libraries)
	
	No.1 cd fs/ntfs = implementation of windows file system
	No.1 grep export_operations 
	No.1 grep "const struct" * ¨ in vim, /const struct file_op
	
	No.2 mnt is a stucture ¨ ppd = mnt ->mnt_sb->s_export_op->get_parent(pd);
	No.2 bunch of struct and then digging out function and calling it
	No.2 cd ext4 ¨ grep -e "->" * ***-e is trying to interpret***
	No.2 grep -3 "->......(" * or you could just follow up with possible names
	No.2 grep fh_to_dentry ¨ nop->fh_to_dentry(mnt->....
	https://github.com/crazyleen/linux-source-3.2/blob/master/fs/exportfs/expfs.c line 379
	
	No.3 grep -e " & " -r *
	
	No.4 grep -i broken * -r or grep -i torvalds | grep -v "Linus Torvalds"
	you can just easily find the online source code and find it out

prinft:
	check the printf_demo.c
	1 command 2 system function 3 c standard liblary = for the man command ex. man 3 printf
	prinft("hi\n"); = simplest way + next 
	./prlineintf_demo

	int x = 100;
	printf("hi %d\n");
	d = integer x = hex c= character f=float lf=longfloat
	
	printf("hi %lx\n", &x); = lx and & tells the address of the variable (stack address)
	printf("hi %lu\n", &x); 
	
pointer review: print out every item in an array
	int A[10] = (2,3,4....);
	
	int* i;
	for(i = A; i< A+10; i++)
		printf("%d ", *i);

	printf
	//this is 64 bit and its moving the pointer due to the array
	//integer is 4 bytes, so the difference of the address is tiny bit
	//if its size_t, then there is little bit more address difference
	
	you can easily check from the example
	if you change the pointer of a by doing a-1, then it will automatically 
	change the address of the b too. 

Function Pointers
call the function by the memory address

Scope:
	check functionpointer.c
	void (*p_foo)(int) = foo;
	(*p_foo) pointer, and then calls vunction with the assigned int
	take a function and call another function thx to void (*p_foo)(int)=foo
	function prototypes 

	in c, you do have to name the function to define it

	type function pointer
	pointer to the function pointer
	
	ex. int (*encode_fh)(struct inode *inode, __u32 *fh, int *max_len, struct inode *parent);
