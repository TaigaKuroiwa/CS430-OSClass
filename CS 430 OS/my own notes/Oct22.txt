Lab5,6,7:
supposed to help you with project3,
and project3 supposed to be the hardest and it is 20%.

Project4,5:
it supposed to be short, so he clunched up together. 

Kernel codes: 
you must try it on the lab computers. 

Interrupt handling works:
Look for the scancode, 
its usually has multipul handler in OS = everything is like 2nd option.

irq handler =
must print something when u press Esc
regardless of you pressed only3 times, it may show 4 times + spaces
it usually happens in the kernel codes, 
IRQ 1 = keyboard, 
irqreturn_t 

keyboard is not that complicated as a kernel module. (only scancode = inb(0x60))
If its USB keyboard, we need to read from USB and all such. 

keyboard scancode
keyboard itself has a light to tell if its caps, but
actually it does not send different scancode. 
it will send extra scancode, but not renew everything
there might be unknown key pressed, 
OS difference? 

Project3:
need to make a password rule.
take the scan code, figure out what those letters(scan code) and see if the password pass the rules
handling the interrupt 
must use /proc and use candidates(?)
15% of bonus if you allow the usb input. 
something will go wrong,
can set timer too, 
these things will be quite dangerous, but also you have chance that you could finish in 2-3 hours.
